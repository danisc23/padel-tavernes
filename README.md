# Padel-Tavernes

This is a Flask api that scrapes the [Esport En Tavernes Blanques](https://www.esportentavernesblanques.es/) website to get the padel (and other sports) reservations.
As the website is quite a mess, the api returns a json with the reservations for the next 7 days, grouped by day and hour allowing to filter by sport, availability and day to avoid the noise.

Also I tested this with other similar websites from [Webs de padel](https://www.websdepadel.com/) and it works mostly in every one, so I added a parameter to the api to change the website to scrape. (Project name outdated in less than a day, ðŸ¥³)

The motivation for this project was just to have fun and to not forget about python since I'm not using it these months. But also I wanted to play around [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) and [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) since I never used them before. Also I must recognice that every time I go back to Valencia and I want to play padel [Playtomic](https://www.playtomic.io/) is always empty since every club is using their own website and apps to book the courts, so I wanted to create a tool that could help me to see all the available courts in one place.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your system.
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for managing Python dependencies.
- [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for linting and formatting.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.12 or higher.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/danisc23/padel-tavernes.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd padel-tavernes
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies using Poetry:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

4. Install pre-commit hooks to ensure consistent code style:

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Development

### Running Locally

To run the application locally, use Poetry's virtual environment:

```bash
poetry shell
python run.py
```

or

```bash
poetry run python run.py
```

The docs will be available at `http://localhost:8080/docs/`.

### Testing

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
poetry run pytest .
```

### Linting

Linting is done using pre-commit hooks. Before committing your code, linting and formatting checks will run automatically. If there are any issues, pre-commit will prevent the commit and inform you of the problems that need to be fixed.

You can also run the pre-commit checks manually using the following command:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Deployment

### Using Docker Compose

To run the application in a Docker container, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. Start the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

The Flask app should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8080/docs/`.

## Contributing

Honestly, this is a project that I did in a couple of hours just to entertain myself and to not forget about python since is my main language but I'm not using it these months. But if you want to contribute, feel free to do it. Just fork the repository, make your changes and submit a pull request.

Maybe would be interesting to extract some other information like statistics about wich courts are more used, sport is played the most, etc.
Or would be interesting to see all the available courts for the different websites like [Playtomic](https://www.playtomic.io/), maybe even create a web that implements this api.

Also take in mind that the website is quite old and padel clubs are moving to other platform so this project could be deprecated soon.
